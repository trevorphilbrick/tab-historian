# Tab Historian
## A chrome tab session tool
An extension to help manage Chrome rabbit holes. When you exit the silo, remember to save your handywork, which will be given a clever nickname. Come back to it at any point to continue down your dark path!

NOTE: You'll need a Gemini API key to use the extension (We generate silly names for the sessions for you). Don't worry the key is just stored locally in chrome.
